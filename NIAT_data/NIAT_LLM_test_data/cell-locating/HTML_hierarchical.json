You will be provided with a table formatted in Markdown, where each row is separated by a newline character and each column within a row is delimited by the “|” symbol. Your task is to carefully read the table and retrieve the value from a specified cell, based on a given row and column ID.\n\nOutput the result as a JSON object in the following format:\n{\"row_ID\": \"m\", \"column_ID\": \"n\", \"cell_value\": \"<Corresponding Cell Value>\"}\n\nPlease note:\n\n•\tRow and column IDs start from 1.\n•\tThe header row is considered the first row, with a row_ID of 1, so ensure you include it when locating the target row.\n•\tIf the target cell is empty, the cell_value should be an empty string (\"\").\n\nGiven table:\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tr> <td rowspan=\"2\"> season </td> <td rowspan=\"2\"> team </td> <td> games </td> <td colspan=\"5\"> overall fgs </td> <td colspan=\"4\"> pats </td> <td colspan=\"5\"> kickoffs </td> <td rowspan=\"2\"> points </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> gp </td> <td> blk </td> <td> lng </td> <td> fg att </td> <td> fgm </td> <td> pct </td> <td> xp att </td> <td> xpm </td> <td> pct </td> <td> blk </td> <td> ko </td> <td> avg </td> <td> tb </td> <td> ret </td> <td> avg </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1996 </td> <td> ne </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 29 </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 2 </td> <td> 66.7 </td> <td> 9 </td> <td> 9 </td> <td> 100.0 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 13 </td> <td> 63.7 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 13 </td> <td> 24.8 </td> <td> 15 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1997 </td> <td> ne </td> <td> 2 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 46 </td> <td> 5 </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 60.0 </td> <td> 2 </td> <td> 2 </td> <td> 100.0 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 7 </td> <td> 61.4 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 6 </td> <td> 20.2 </td> <td> 11 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1998 </td> <td> ne </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 27 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 100.0 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 100.0 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 64.0 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 22.0 </td> <td> 4 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2001 </td> <td> ne </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 48 </td> <td> 7 </td> <td> 6 </td> <td> 85.7 </td> <td> 6 </td> <td> 6 </td> <td> 100.0 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 13 </td> <td> 62.2 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 13 </td> <td> 19.9 </td> <td> 24 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2003 </td> <td> ne </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 46 </td> <td> 10 </td> <td> 7 </td> <td> 70.0 </td> <td> 6 </td> <td> 6 </td> <td> 100.0 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 17 </td> <td> 59.6 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 17 </td> <td> 20.8 </td> <td> 27 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2004 </td> <td> ne </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 48 </td> <td> 5 </td> <td> 5 </td> <td> 100.0 </td> <td> 10 </td> <td> 10 </td> <td> 100.0 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 18 </td> <td> 58.1 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 17 </td> <td> 16.9 </td> <td> 25 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2005 </td> <td> ne </td> <td> 2 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 40 </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 2 </td> <td> 66.7 </td> <td> 5 </td> <td> 5 </td> <td> 100.0 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 9 </td> <td> 62.8 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 9 </td> <td> 20.1 </td> <td> 11 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2006 </td> <td> ind </td> <td> 4 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 51 </td> <td> 15 </td> <td> 14 </td> <td> 93.3 </td> <td> 7 </td> <td> 7 </td> <td> 100.0 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 26 </td> <td> 61.0 </td> <td> 2 </td> <td> 23 </td> <td> 24.0 </td> <td> 49 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2007 </td> <td> ind </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 46 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 100.0 </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 100.0 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 5 </td> <td> 73.2 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 4 </td> <td> 25.8 </td> <td> 6 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2008 </td> <td> ind </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 43 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 100.0 </td> <td> 2 </td> <td> 2 </td> <td> 100.0 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 5 </td> <td> 71.8 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 4 </td> <td> 26.5 </td> <td> 5 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2010 </td> <td> ind </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 50 </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 3 </td> <td> 100.0 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 100.0 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> -

Your task is to carefully read the table and retrieve the value from a specified cell, based on a given row and column ID.\n\nOutput the result as a JSON object in the following format:\n{\"row_ID\": \"m\", \"column_ID\": \"n\", \"cell_value\": \"<Corresponding Cell Value>\"}\n\nPlease note:\n\n•\tRow and column IDs start from 1.\n•\tThe header row is considered the first row, with a row_ID of 1, so ensure you include it when locating the target row.\n•\tIf the target cell is empty, the cell_value should be an empty string (\"\").\n\nGiven table:\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n
